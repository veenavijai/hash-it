# Hash It!

Hash It was built at Hacktech 2019 in Caltech.

## Motivation

As photography becomes increasingly spontaneous, people need an efficient way to determine hashtags for their photos without wasting a minute.

## How does Hash It help?

Hash It combines Google Cloud's powerful Vision API with a tastefully minimalistic interface to provide appropriate, real-time hashtags. Our app aims to lessen the amount of time you spend documenting your life by doing the thinking for you.

## What was Hash It built?

Hash It was primarily made using React Native. We utilized the Google Cloud Vision API with the credits we received courtesy of MLH. We also incorporated Google's Firebase API for the backend and database functionality.
